POSIX | Portable Operating System Interface

POSIX = Portable Operating System Interface, is a set of standards specifying the interface between a computer's operating system and application programs. It was developed by the IEEE to promote compatibility between operating systems. A POSIX-compliant environment provides a set of guidelines for how software interfaces with the operating system, covering aspects such as file systems, system calls, and command-line interfaces. POSIX aims to make it easier to write software that is compatible with multiple operating systems. Not all operating systems strictly adhere to POSIX standards, and some may have extensions or variations. The goal of POSIX is to facilitate interoperability between different systems

UML = Unified Modeling Language - is a standardized modeling language consisting of an integrated set of diagrams, developed to help system and software developers for specifying, visualizing, constructing, and documenting the artifacts of software systems, as well as for business modeling and other non-software systems. The UML represents a collection of best engineering practices that have proven successful in the modeling of large and complex systems. The UML is a very important part of developing object oriented software and the software development process. The UML uses mostly graphical notations to express the design of software projects. Using the UML helps project teams communicate, explore potential designs, and validate the architectural design of the software.

YAML = Yet Another Markup Language or YAML Ain't Markup Language - is a human friendly data serialization language for all programming languages that is often used for writing configuration files. YAML has broad language support and maps easily into native data structures. It's also easy to for humans to read, which is why it's a good choice for configuration. Also, its object serialization abilities make it a viable replacement for languages like JSON. YAML is a superset of JSON and any JSON file is also a valid YAML file.

AMQP = Advanced Message Queuing Protocol - is an open standard application layer protocol for message-oriented middleware. The defining features of AMQP are message orientation, queuing, routing, reliability and security.

URL = Uniform Resource Locator - is a URI that specifies the means of acting upon or obtaining the representation of a resource, i.e. specifying both its primary access mechanism and network location. For example, the URL http://example.org/wiki/Main_Page refers to a resource identified as /wiki/Main_Page, whose representation, in the form of HTML and related code, is obtainable via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (http:) from a network host whose domain name is example.org.

URI = Uniform Resource Identifier - is a string of characters that unambiguously identifies a particular resource. To guarantee uniformity, all URIs follow a predefined set of syntax rules: URI = scheme:[//authority]path[?query][#fragment]

XHR = XMLHttpRequest - The XMLHttpRequest object can be used to request data from a web server. Update a web page without reloading the page. Request data from a server - after the page has loaded. Receive data from a server  - after the page has loaded. Send data to a server - in the background

BEM = Block, Element, Modifier - a naming convention for writing CSS classes.

ORM = Object Relational Mapper - long story short, we are trying to interact with our database using our language of choice instead of SQL. When most people say “ORM” they are referring to a library that implements this technique.

Thread - a single process that a program can use to complete tasks. Each thread can only do a single task at once. Each task will be run sequentially; a task has to complete before the next one can be started. Many computers now have multiple cores, so can do multiple things at once. Programming languages that can support multiple threads can use multiple cores to complete multiple tasks simultaneously:

IDE = Integrated Development Environment - a software app that has different tools needed for development & testing, such as a source code editor, build tools, a compiler or interpreter,  a debugger.

DOM = Document Object Model: an API for HTML and XML documents, used by browsers to render these documents. The DOM specifies the logical structure of a document, and represents it as a node tree in which nodes are objects that represent different parts of the document. Nodes can be created, modified, and removed.

CDN = content delivery network - a network of distributed servers that store duplicate copies of our web content, CDNs allow us to deliver content to each user from a server that is closer to their location or less overloaded. This way we can achieve better performance and reduce server downtime.

ECMAScript = European Computer Manufacturers Association Script - a scripting language specification on which the syntax of JavaScript is based.

FOSS = Free and Open-Source Software - a software that is free in the sense that it doesn’t have any constraints on copyrights, and open-source in the sense that anyone can access and modify the source code of the software.

IIFE = Immediately Invoked Function Expression - a popular JS design pattern that creates a lexical scope. It's a function expression that is executed immediately after it’s evaluated. It can be used for storing code that needs to be executed only once, namespacing?, and creating private variables and closures.

JSON = JavaScript Object Notation - a language-independent, human-readable data format for interchanging data. It can store objects as collections of name-value pairs, and arrays as ordered collections of values. Its the most common data format in JS-based applications.

LAMP = Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Python/Perl - a popular web stack for creating dynamic websites. It stack consists of Linux as OS, Apache as web server, MySQL as DB management software, and PHP, Perl or Python as scripting language. Its Windows variant is called WAMP, while its OS X variant is MAMP.

MVC = Model-View-Controller - an architectural pattern used in OOP. It keeps the data logic separate from the user interface by grouping objects into three groups: Model Objects for the underlying data structure and logic, View Objects for the user interface, and Controller Objects for acting as intermediary between other objects and for task coordination.

OAuth = Open Authentication - an open protocol that makes secure authorization possible in a safe and standardised way. OAuth is frequently used as a method for enabling users to log in to a site using third-party services, such as Facebook, Twitter, or Google – this way removing the barrier of registration.

OOP = Object-Oriented Programming: A programming paradigm as opposed to procedural programming. In OOP, we create models similar to the real-world environment by making use of four major principles: abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance & polymorphism. At the centre of OOP, there are objects that hold encapsulated data in the form of properties and methods.

Abstraction = in computer programming is a way to reduce complexity and allow efficient design and implementation in complex software systems. It hides the technical complexity of systems behind simpler APIs.

Polymorphism = is the presentation of one interface for multiple data types. 
For example, integers, floats, and doubles are implicitly polymorphic: regardless of their different types, they can all be added, subtracted, multiplied, and so on. In the case of OOP, by making the class responsible for its code as well as its own data, polymorphism can be achieved in that each class has its own function that (once called) behaves properly for any object.

REST = Representational State Transfer - set of design architectural guidelines for data transmission between client and server. Following the principles of the REST architecture, we can create RESTful APIs for our web applications.

SCM = Source Control Management: a system for managing multiple versions of the same document, application, code, or other kind of information. Also called version or revision control management. SCM makes it possible to keep track of changes, and prevent information loss. The most popular SCM systems are Git and SVN.
