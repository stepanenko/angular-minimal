**OpenID** is an open standard and decentralized authentication protocol.
It allows users to be authenticated by cooperating sites (known as relying parties, or RP) using a third-party identity provider (IDP) service,
eliminating the need for webmasters to provide their own login systems, and allowing users to log into multiple unrelated websites without having to have a separate identity and password for each. 
Users create accounts by selecting an OpenID identity provider, and then use those accounts to sign onto any website that accepts OpenID authentication.
Several large organizations either issue or accept OpenIDs on their websites.
