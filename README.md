# Computer Science and Engineering

A CPU cycle, or clock cycle represents the time it takes for one complete cycle of a CPU to fetch, decode, execute, and write back an instruction.
The CPU cycle is often measured in hertz (Hz), where one hertz is equal to one cycle per second.
For example, a CPU with a clock speed of 2 gigahertz (2 GHz) can perform 2 billion cycles per second.

One complete cycle of a computer's CPU, also known as a clock cycle, involves the following stages:
- Fetch: The CPU retrieves the next instruction from the computer's memory.
- Decode: The fetched instruction is interpreted by the CPU to understand what operation needs to be performed.
- Execute: The CPU performs the operation or task specified by the decoded instruction.
- Write Back: The results of the executed instruction are written back to the appropriate registers or memory locations.
